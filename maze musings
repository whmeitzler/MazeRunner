Logic of maze runner:

[B][W][B]
White is in between 2 non-whites
Path running forward
Move forward

[B][B][B]
All Blacks
Dead end;
turn around

[W][W][W]
White in the center and 1+ other whites
Multiple paths. Follow rightmost path. Mark that this is an intersection?

[*][R][*]
Red dead ahead
Move forward
End found!

Intersections are the challenge
How do I keep track of where there are unexplored paths?
Keep a map of intersections?
Don't bother with paths, we can follow a line
Just turn the right way!

So:
Follow all paths
Identify and store all intersections
Dead ends count as an intersection with only one point
Note intersection you just left so you can update appropriate values
Go to start and spin
Beep
Go to end 
Profit
???

Weighted lines would be useful to find the absolute shortest path
